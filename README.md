Introduction
------------
Dropbox Uploader Compress is a fork of Andrea Fabrizi's Dropbox-Uploader (https://github.com/andreafabrizi/Dropbox-Uploader).  It includes a Perl wrapper that adds extra functionality (folder compression, and target file/folder custom names for example.)  It does not change (and has no intentions of changing) Dropbox-Uploader.
